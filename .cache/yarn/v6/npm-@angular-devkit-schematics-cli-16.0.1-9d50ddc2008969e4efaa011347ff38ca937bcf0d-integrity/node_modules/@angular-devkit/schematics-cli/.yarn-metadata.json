This is true by default if the collection is a relative\n                        path (in that case, turn off with --debug=false).\n\n    --allow-private     Allow private schematics to be run from the command line. Default to\n                        false.\n\n    --dry-run           Do not output anything, but instead just show what actions would be\n                        performed. Default to true if debug is also true.\n\n    --force             Force overwriting files that would otherwise be an error.\n\n    --list-schematics   List all schematics from the collection, by name. A collection name\n                        should be suffixed by a colon. Example: '@angular-devkit/schematics-cli:'.\n\n    --no-interactive    Disables interactive input prompts.\n\n    --verbose           Show more information.\n\n    --help              Show this message.\n\nAny additional option is passed to the Schematics depending on its schema.\n```\n\n# Examples\n\n1. Create a new NPM package that contains a blank schematic.\n\n```sh\n$ schematics blank <name>\n```\n\n2. Walkthrough example that demonstrates how to build a schematic.\n\n```sh\n$ schematics schematic --name <name>\n```\n",
